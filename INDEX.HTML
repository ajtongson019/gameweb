        <h1>BEGINNER'S GUIDE</h1>
        <h2>Wanna get good at <span style="color: red;">VALORANT</span> ? Here’s your first stop.</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome to the Beginner’s Guide! Whether you’re new to the club or need a refresher, we’re here to cover everything you need to know to have a good grasp on the game. This page also includes various video guides made for you by some of the most beloved and respected players in our community. They’re pretty cracked so you should check them out.</p>
        <img src="whatis.jpg" alt="">

        <h2>AGENTS</h1>
        <p>Before you enter your first round, you’ll start by navigating through the Agent Select screen. This is an essential part of your preparation, where you’ll have the exciting opportunity to choose from a diverse group of 24 unique Agents, each offering their own special abilities and playstyles. These Agents are thoughtfully divided into four distinct roles—Duelists, Initiators, Controllers, and Sentinels—each fulfilling specific functions that contribute to your team’s overall strategy and effectiveness in the game.As you delve into the selection process, you might notice that not all Agents are available to you right away if you’re using a new account. This limitation adds an element of progression to the game, encouraging you to engage more deeply with its mechanics. The more matches you play and the more experience you gain, the quicker you’ll be able to unlock these Agents. This gradual unlocking process allows you to familiarize yourself with each character’s abilities and how they fit into different team compositions, enhancing your gameplay experience and ensuring that you develop a well-rounded understanding of the game’s dynamics. So, gear up and strategize as you select your Agent—your journey is just beginning!</p>
        <img src="choose.jpg" alt="chos">
        <p>Each Agent in the game boasts a distinct set of skills and abilities that are meticulously crafted to complement one another, working synergistically towards achieving victory. While it’s not strictly mandatory for your team of five to encompass every role, you’ll quickly find that having a well-rounded and diverse roster significantly enhances your chances of success. When each player takes on a specific duty aligned with their Agent’s strengths, the team becomes more formidable and versatile on the battlefield.For instance, consider the pivotal role of a Controller. This type of Agent specializes in manipulating the battlefield, making it much easier for your team to execute strategies and gain control of critical areas. If you have a Controller on your squad, they can deploy smokes and other abilities to obscure sight lines that enemies might be monitoring, creating opportunities for your team to push onto a site effectively.Moreover, this dynamic interplay among different roles—Duelists who excel at aggressive engagements, Initiators who can disrupt enemy setups, and Sentinels who provide support and healing—further solidifies the importance of teamwork. By coordinating and communicating effectively, you and your teammates can leverage your Agents’ unique capabilities, leading to well-orchestrated plays that capitalize on the strengths of each role. Embracing this diversity not only elevates your gameplay but also fosters a more engaging and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.</p>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top: 7%;">ROUNDS & ECONOMY</h2>
        <p>After all players have made their selections and chosen their Agents, the excitement builds as you’ll be thrust into a random map, officially entering the first round of play. The anticipation is palpable as you prepare to engage in a strategic showdown.Each round begins with players assuming the roles of either attackers or defenders, setting the stage for the unique challenges that lie ahead. After a total of 12 rounds, teams will switch sides, allowing both attackers and defenders to experience different aspects of the game and adapt their strategies accordingly.Before each round kicks off, you’ll have a crucial preparation period. This time allows you to strategize and spend your hard-earned credits on various items and skills to enhance your chances of success in the upcoming round. Your choices here are critical, as they should reflect your Agent's abilities and your preferred playstyle.Consider your options carefully: do you want to invest in a skill that provides healing for your team, bolstering your squad’s sustainability during intense engagements? Or would you prefer to acquire a more powerful weapon to dominate your enemies and secure key eliminations? The decisions you make in this preparation phase can significantly influence the flow of the game, so think strategically about what will best support your team’s objectives and complement your overall strategy. The right purchases can turn the tide of battle, making this preparation period a vital component of your gameplay experience.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 7%;">WEAPONS</h2>
        <p>In VALORANT, you’ll find that there’s a gun perfectly suited for every conceivable situation on the battlefield. The game features a diverse arsenal, with each weapon designed to fulfill specific roles and tactical needs. For a comprehensive understanding of your options, be sure to explore our dedicated arsenal page, where you can delve into the details of each weapon, including their stats, costs, and unique characteristics.When you’re uncertain about which weapon to purchase, a good strategy is to base your decision on the type of weapon and how it aligns with your playstyle, skill level, and your team’s overall strategy. For example, if you prefer aggressive gameplay, you might gravitate towards submachine guns or rifles that offer a good balance of fire rate and damage. Conversely, if you favor a more defensive approach, shotguns or snipers might be more to your liking.Keep in mind that you won’t always have the credits necessary to buy your preferred weapon. This limitation encourages experimentation; don’t hesitate to try out different guns to discover which ones resonate with you the most. By testing various weapons in different scenarios, you’ll gain valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, preparing you to adapt to any situation that arises during gameplay. With practice and exploration, you’ll refine your choices, ensuring that you’re always equipped for success, no matter the circumstances.</p>
        <img src="weapon.jpg" alt="wep">
        <h2>MAPS</h2>
        <p>In VALORANT, players can explore a total of 11 unique maps, each serving as a dynamic stage for you to outmaneuver and outsmart your enemies. You can check them out here, where you’ll find detailed descriptions and layouts of each map. Each one offers different environments and challenges, encouraging you to flex your creative skills and showcase your gunplay as you implement various strategies tailored to the map you’re playing on.To maximize your effectiveness in each match, it’s crucial to learn and memorize the intricacies of these maps. Understanding key locations, choke points, and sightlines can give you a significant advantage over your opponents. Take note of where your enemies might approach from and keep an eye on those angles. And remember, checking your corners is essential—unexpected encounters can often turn the tide of a round.You may also find that your choice of Agent can greatly influence your performance on specific maps. Certain maps feature high platforms or verticality that can make Agents with abilities to jump, teleport, or traverse these areas much more appealing. For example, an Agent with mobility skills can take advantage of these elevated spots to surprise enemies or secure advantageous positions. By aligning your preferred playstyle with the right Agents and maps, you can create powerful synergies that elevate your gameplay and enhance your overall experience in VALORANT.</p>

        <h1>LEARN THE <span style="color: rgb(58, 167, 255);">BASICS</span></h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">There’s a lot to learn about League, so we’ll start with the essentials. Explore the guide below to get the rundown on the most popular game mode.</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 7%;">League of Legends is an engaging team-based strategy game that pits two teams of five formidable champions against each other in a quest to destroy the opposing team’s Nexus. With a roster of over 140 champions at your disposal, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles, you have the freedom to create dynamic team compositions that can adapt to any situation.As you dive into the action, you'll engage in epic plays, secure crucial kills, and strategically take down enemy towers. Each match is a test of skill, teamwork, and strategy, where coordination with your teammates can lead to incredible victories. Whether you prefer to be the nimble assassin darting in and out of combat, the tank soaking up damage for your team, or the support providing vital healing and crowd control, there's a champion for every playstyle.With constant updates and new champions regularly introduced, League of Legends offers an ever-evolving battlefield where players can hone their skills and develop strategies to outsmart their opponents. So gear up, choose your champion wisely, and get ready to battle your way to victory!</p>
        <img src="league1.webp" alt="s">
        <h2>DESTROY THE BASE</h2>
        <p>The Nexus serves as the heart of both teams’ bases in League of Legends, acting as the ultimate objective that players must strive to destroy to claim victory. Located at the center of each base, the Nexus is protected by two sets of defensive towers that players must dismantle before they can reach it.To win the game, your primary goal is to destroy the enemy's Nexus before they do the same to yours. This requires strategic planning, teamwork, and effective execution throughout the match. As you and your teammates battle your way through the lanes, you’ll need to coordinate your attacks, secure objectives like turrets and inhibitors, and maintain control of key areas on the map.The destruction of the Nexus signifies the end of the game, marking your team’s triumph in the intense strategic showdown. So, stay focused, communicate effectively with your teammates, and work together to break through your opponent’s defenses and secure that all-important victory!</p>
        <img src="nexus.webp" alt="n">
        <h2>CLEAR THE PATH</h2>
        <p>To reach the enemy Nexus in League of Legends, your team must clear at least one lane, navigating through a series of defensive structures that stand in your way. These structures, known as turrets and inhibitors, play a crucial role in defending the enemy base.Each lane is equipped with three turrets that provide cover and protection for the enemy champions. These turrets deal significant damage to any enemy that comes within range, making them formidable obstacles that require careful planning and coordination to take down. Beyond the turrets, each lane also features one inhibitor, which, when destroyed, allows your team to spawn super minions in that lane. These super minions can help push the lane further, putting additional pressure on the enemy team.As you make your way toward the enemy Nexus, keep in mind that the Nexus itself is guarded by two additional turrets. These final defenses must be overcome before you can deliver the decisive blow to the Nexus. Successfully navigating and dismantling these defensive structures is essential for creating pathways to the enemy base, ultimately setting the stage for your team to secure victory. Stay vigilant, communicate with your teammates, and strategize effectively to clear these lanes and push toward the enemy Nexus!</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 7%;">TURRETS</h2>
        <p>Turrets play a vital role in League of Legends, dealing damage to both enemy minions and champions while providing limited vision in areas obscured by the Fog of War for your team. Their presence not only helps protect your team’s base but also grants strategic advantages by revealing enemy movements nearby.To effectively approach and take down these structures, it’s advisable to use your minions as a shield. Sending your minions ahead to absorb the turret’s damage allows you to minimize your own risk while dealing damage to the turret itself. As your minions engage the turret, you can safely attack from behind, allowing you to charge ahead and apply pressure on the structure without taking unnecessary damage.Coordinating with your team during this process is crucial. You’ll want to ensure that your champions are positioned to support one another, whether it’s by providing crowd control, healing, or additional damage. By leveraging the protection of your minions and working together as a team, you can dismantle turrets more efficiently and pave the way toward the enemy’s Nexus. Stay focused, communicate, and make the most of your minion wave to push forward effectively!</p>
        <img src="turret.webp" alt="tur">
        <h2>INHIBITORS</h2>
        <p>Each Inhibitor in League of Legends is protected by a turret, serving as an important defensive structure that your team must overcome to gain a significant advantage. When you successfully destroy an Inhibitor, it triggers the spawning of super minions in that lane for several minutes. These super minions are much stronger than regular minions and can help create overwhelming pressure on the enemy team, allowing your team to push further into their territory.After you destroy the Inhibitor, it won’t remain permanently out of commission. Instead, it will respawn after a certain amount of time, at which point super minions will stop spawning in that lane. This means that timing is crucial; after taking down an Inhibitor, you’ll want to capitalize on the opportunity to push your advantage quickly. Use the super minions to apply pressure on enemy structures, force the enemy champions to respond, and potentially create openings for your team to secure objectives or take down turrets.However, keep in mind that while the Inhibitor is down, the enemy team will likely focus on defending and reclaiming control of the lane. Communication and coordination with your teammates will be essential to make the most of the super minions and maintain your momentum until the Inhibitor respawns. Stay aggressive, but also be cautious of enemy ambushes as you push toward victory!</p>
        <img src="inhib.webp" alt="">
        <h2>TAKE ON THE JUNGLE</h2>
        <p>In League of Legends, the area between the lanes is known as the jungle, a rich environment filled with neutral monsters and jungle plants that offer valuable resources for your team. Among the various creatures that inhabit the jungle, two of the most significant are Baron Nashor and the Drakes.Baron Nashor is a powerful neutral monster located in the Baron pit, and defeating it grants your team a significant advantage. Upon killing Baron Nashor, your team receives the Baron buff, which enhances the strength of your minions, making them tougher and granting them increased damage. This buff can be pivotal in pushing lanes and applying pressure on the enemy team, often leading to critical team fights and objective control.Drakes, on the other hand, are elemental creatures found in different areas of the jungle, each providing unique buffs that can greatly enhance your team’s capabilities. There are several types of Drakes, including Infernal, Ocean, Mountain, and Cloud, each offering distinct advantages such as increased damage, healing, or movement speed. Securing these Drakes not only grants buffs but also contributes to your team's overall power level throughout the game.</p>
        <img src="br.webp" alt="zehahaha">
        <h2>UNLOCK YOUR ABILITIES</h2>
        <p>In League of Legends, each champion is equipped with a unique set of abilities and items that play a crucial role in their effectiveness during matches. Champions typically have five core abilities, which include one passive ability and four active abilities that define their playstyle and role within the team.In League of Legends, each champion is equipped with a unique set of abilities and items that play a crucial role in their effectiveness during matches. Champions typically have five core abilities, which include one passive ability and four active abilities that define their playstyle and role within the team.In addition to their abilities, champions can also utilize two Summoner Spells, which are powerful spells chosen at the start of the match. These spells can provide critical utility, mobility, or healing, and selecting the right ones for your champion can greatly enhance your impact on the game.Furthermore, champions can build up to seven items at any given time. Items offer various stats and effects that can significantly boost your champion’s performance. The optimal combination of items often depends on your champion's role, the state of the game, and the enemy team composition.Figuring out the ideal ability order, summoner spells, and item build is essential for maximizing your champion’s potential and contributing effectively to your team’s success. Understanding the synergy between your abilities and items will allow you to adapt to different scenarios, whether you’re dealing damage, providing support, or tanking damage for your teammates.Regularly reviewing guides, experimenting with builds, and practicing different champions will help you refine your approach and improve your gameplay. By mastering these elements, you’ll be better equipped to face your opponents and lead your team to victory!</p>
